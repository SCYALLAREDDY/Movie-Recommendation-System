# Movie-Recommendation-System
## Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using the Netflix dataset. The recommendation system employs content-based filtering techniques based on movie descriptions and collaborative filtering techniques based on user ratings. The project is built in R and utilizes various libraries for data manipulation, text processing, and visualization.

## Features

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity of their descriptions.

Collaborative Filtering: Provides recommendations based on user ratings and preferences.

Visualizations: Displays the recommended movies with their ratings and genres.

Easy to Use: Functions for recommending movies based on single or multiple genres.

## Dataset
